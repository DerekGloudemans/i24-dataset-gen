conf_new==0.8 # required confidence for new object by detector
iou_overlap==0.7 # objects that overlap by _ are trimmed
W==0.5 # weights confidence in matching objects (if 1, conf weighted equally to iou. If 0, conf not considered at all)
conf_loc==0.3 # bboxes with conf below _ are considered low confidence

iou_match==0.9 # boxes with less overlap than 1- _ are not valid matches
fsld_max==3 # objects with low-confidence bboxes associated _ frames will be killed (-1 = no limit)
fsld_keep==15 # after _ frames, an object is tracked indefinitely
mode=="iou" # use KIOU or SORT (iou or linear)
